// The one place a flowchart node's box is derived from its text (#441 items 5, 6,
// 14) — the flowchart counterpart of mindmapNodeSize.js.
//
// The difference from a mind map, and the whole reason this module exists: a
// mind-map node is always a rounded rectangle, so one padding constant describes
// it. A flowchart node is eleven different shapes, and most of them are NOT the
// rectangle their x/y/w/h suggests. A diamond wastes three quarters of its box on
// the four corners outside the slanted edges; a document's bottom edge is a wave
// that dips below the text; a cylinder's top rim arcs down into it; a junction is
// a circle whose usable area is the inscribed square.
//
// Editing text used to treat every one of them as a plain rectangle, which is what
// produced the failures in the issue: "Decision?" wrapping one character per line
// inside a diamond that then stretched off-screen, and a document's label sitting
// on top of its own wave.
//
// So each type declares the dead space on each of its four sides as `{ k, c }` —
// a FRACTION of that axis plus a constant. The fraction is what makes it exact:
// the dead space in a diamond is proportional to its size, not a fixed inset. It
// also makes the box solvable in closed form rather than by iteration, since
//
//   w = textWidth + kLeft*w + cLeft + kRight*w + cRight
//     = (textWidth + cLeft + cRight) / (1 - kLeft - kRight)
//
// Deterministic and DOM-free (no canvas measureText), like mindmapNodeSize, so it
// stays unit-testable under vitest's node environment and gives the same answer on
// every machine. What matters is that the renderer and the live editor inset by
// the same frame this measured, so the wrap the box was sized for is the wrap that
// is drawn and text can never escape the shape.

// which turned a Process into a letterbox and a Decision into a lozenge — the box
// stopped looking like the shape it was supposed to be. Growing both axes by the
// same factor is what keeps a diamond a diamond.
//
// The search is a bisect rather than a formula because the fit is not continuous:
// widening the box changes how many characters fit per line, so the line count —

// the part of the box the SHAPE itself takes away (it scales with the box); `c` is
// the breathing room between the text and that edge (it does not).
//
// The k values are read straight off flowchartShapes.js, so the two stay in step:
//   - decision: the maximal axis-aligned rect inside a diamond is half its width
//     and half its height (a/hw + b/hh = 1 at a = hw/2, b = hh/2) — a quarter of
//     the box lost on each side of each axis.
//   - document: the bottom edge is drawn from 0.82h and the wave dips to h.
//   - database: the top rim is a 0.16h ellipse arced BOTH ways, so it eats ~0.30h
//     at the top and 0.16h at the bottom.
//   - manualInput: the top edge slopes down from 0.28h.
//   - preparation: the hexagon's points cut 0.16w off each side.
//   - offPageRef: the pentagon narrows to a point from 0.62h down.
//   - connector: the inscribed square of a circle leaves (1 - 1/√2)/2 ≈ 0.146 per
//     side on both axes.
//   - inputOutput: the parallelogram's skew is 18px at every on-canvas width
//     (flowchartShapes caps it as a fraction only below ~100px, far under any node
//     box), so it is a constant here rather than a fraction.
